# 📊 Data Mining & Warehousing Wages Analysis
**Uncovering Insights from the 2019 Kaggle ML & DS Survey Dataset**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Welcome to our data mining and warehousing project! This repository dives into the **2019 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey** to explore connections between **education levels, programming language preferences, and wages** among data science professionals. By performing comprehensive data mining and warehousing, we uncover how education and language skills shape career outcomes in data science.

---

## 🏆 Project Goals
- **Analyze** the impact of education on wage trends in data science.
- **Identify** preferred programming languages across different experience levels.
- **Visualize** key patterns and trends within the field.

Our team leveraged data mining techniques to **preprocess, model, and analyze** the dataset, and designed an optimized data warehousing solution to structure and store it for efficient querying.
